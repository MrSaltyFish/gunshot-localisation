# Gunshot Localization
This repository contains the Project created by me, @aryakashikar and @omicron9009 which uses an array of microphones placed in a grid-like structure to trace the path of a bullet.
The front-end UI currently displays circle maps for both direction location of shot fired from the center of the microphone.
